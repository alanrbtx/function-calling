Function calling is the ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable effective tool usage and interaction with external APIs

LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have been fine-tuned to detect when a function needs to be called and then output JSON containing arguments to call the function

The functions that are being called by function calling will act as tools in your AI application and you can define more than one in a single request.
